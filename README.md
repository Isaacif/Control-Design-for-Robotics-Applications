# Control-Design-for-Robotics-Applications
Implementation of a fully dedicated platform for Robotic Interfacing and Control applications. 
It covers the whole process of designing low-level software for control and communications as well as supervision and interface systems.

The control scheme supports the following tools:
  STM32F103 using the libopencm3 framework
  STM32F103 using the Arduino framework
  ATmega328p using the Arduino framework

Web server using an ESP32

GUI software using Klampt and PyQt5
